Singleton is more an anti-desing pattern than a design pattern.

Singleton is a hidden global variable, the difference being that access can be managed using encapsulation.

Cases where Singleton can be useful:
- Access to an expensive resource.It could be the cost of creation or cost of action
- The use of the object doe snot impact the programme iself (logs).
